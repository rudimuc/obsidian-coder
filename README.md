## Usage

Following conversions are available

| Source    | Destination   | Markdown keyword       |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|
| text      | base64        | transform-text-base64  |
| base64    | text          | transform-base64-text  |
| text      | base85        | transform-text-base85  |
| base85    | text          | transform-base85-text  |
| text      | ROT13         | transform-text-rot13   |
| ROT13     | text          | transform-rot13-text   |
| text      | atbash        | transform-text-atbash  |
| atbash    | text          | transform-atbash-text  |


Type the Markdown keyword to use the specific encoding.

For example if you like to print out a given text as base64 you have to write:

````markdown
```transform-text-base64
this is a text to encode
```
````

The result will be this:
